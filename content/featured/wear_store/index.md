TailorCloth, a leading tailoring company from Krakow, partnered with Media Hunters for a comprehensive digital transformation. The project included the design and implementation of a responsive website on Odoo, customized product management modules, and a secure platform for trusted users. By integrating local and international invoicing systems and automating warehouse processes, TailorCloth enhanced operational efficiency. An innovative, no-price ordering system was also developed, allowing for tailored business offers that strengthened customer relationships and improved overall satisfaction.
